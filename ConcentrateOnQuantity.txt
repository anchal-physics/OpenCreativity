Each participant is given a piece of paper with 30 blank circles on it,
a pencil and 3 minutes on the clock.  You are challenged to fill in as
many circles as possible- with the aim being quantity, not quality. Maybe
all your circles are variations on a theme, perhaps they are all emojis â€¦
your one goal was to fill out as many as possible.
