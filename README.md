# OpenCreativity
This repos holds the treasure which serves as the food for our creativity. We will fill it up over time and use the program to have somefun open mics and creative activities.

## Program
### 1) Open mic invitation

All open mics welcome poem, song, music, art, standup, speech, short story 
or anything to show or talk about really.

###  2) Games Session I:
* I can explain...:
  
  Show the four images. Write a short anecdote, poem or song with
  "I can explain..." as part of first 5 sentences in 5 min.
* Concentrate on quantity:

  Each participant is given a piece of paper with 30 blank circles on it,
  a pencil and 3 minutes on the clock.  You are challenged to fill in as
  many circles as possible- with the aim being quantity, not quality. Maybe
  all your circles are variations on a theme, perhaps they are all emojis â€¦
  your one goal was to fill out as many as possible.

### 3) Open mic invitation

### 4) Games Session II:
* Describe the scene:

  Imagine you are an author writing a fiction. Using one of the 4
  paintings, describe an imagined scene as an opening of a chapter in your
  book. It can be very different from the painting. Painting is only for
  inspiration.
* Complete the picture:

  Using one of the 7 phrases, draw a sketch in 5 minutes.
