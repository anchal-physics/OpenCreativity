Grab a pencil, some paper and give yourself five minutes.
However, instead of looking at the page while you are drawing,
turn around, hold up your hand and look only at your hand while drawing,
NOT the paper.

Your aim is to draw the creases, folds, and marks of your hand and not
your entire hand. Oh, and you also canâ€™t pick up your pencil for the
entire five minutes.
